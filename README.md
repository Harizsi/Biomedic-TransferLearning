# Biomedic Cell Nuclei - Transfer Learning Semantic Segmentation.

## Description
A New Tool to Speed Up Medical Research

Scientists are working on a new tool that can automatically find cell nuclei. This tool could help researchers study many diseases, like cancer, heart disease, and rare conditions. It could speed up the process of finding cures for these diseases and help people who are sick.

Cell nuclei are important because they contain DNA, which is the building block of life. By studying cell nuclei, researchers can learn how cells work and how diseases affect them. This new tool could help researchers analyze DNA faster and more accurately, leading to faster drug development and better treatments.
